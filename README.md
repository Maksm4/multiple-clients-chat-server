    DESCRIPTION
This project is a java based chat application between users using text messages in the GUI view.
It uses the TCP protocol to send and receive messages which ensures the reliable and real time 
messaging between clients and server. Unfortunetely it uses the plain, vanilla not encrypted TCP 
which could lead to leaks.
